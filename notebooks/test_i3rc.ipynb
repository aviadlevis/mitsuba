    "## Intercomparison of 3D Radiation Codes (I3RC): https://i3rc.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Description\n",
    "I3RC is an ongoing project initiated in the late 1990s. Its goals include: \n",
    "- Comparing methods available for 3D atmospheric radiative transfer calculations.\n",
    "- Providing benchmark results for testing and debugging 3D radiative transfer codes.\n",
    "- Publishing an open source toolkit (community 3D Monte Carlo code).\n",
    "- Helping atmospheric science education by creating an archive of illustrative images and other resources on 3D radiative transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmark test-cases are devided into three phases. This notebook implements them for the mitsuba-renderer (https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/), comparing it to gold-standard atmospheric science codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Phase I\n",
    "Includes several baseline radiative computations for 3D radiative transfer through the following cloud fields:\n",
    "1. 1D academic 'step' cloud field\n",
    "2. 2D field derived from the ARM cloud radar\n",
    "3. 3D field derived from radiances measured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "These computations involved cloud and surface only (i.e., no gases or aerosol) and were monochromatic, with scattering and absorption only (i.e., no emission), and were completed independently at each participants' home institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",

    "   2. transmittance (T)\n",
    "   3. absorptance (wherever applicable) (A)\n",
    "   4. net horizontal flux (H) defined as $1-R-T-A$\n",
    "   5. nadir reflectivity (Iu) defined as $\\pi\\nu / (F \\mu_0)$ where: \n",
    "       - $\\nu$ - upward exiting radiance at 0 degrees\n",
    "       - $\\mu_0$ - cosine of the solar zenith angle\n",
    "       - $F=1$ is the incident solar flux\n",
    "   6. oblique reflectivities (Io) defined as $\\pi N_o / (F\\mu_0)$ where:\n",
    "       - $N_o$ - upward exiting radiance at 60 degrees zenith and 0 and 180 degrees azimuth angles (i.e. two oblique reflectivities are requested)\n",
    "   7. zenith transmissivity (Id) defined as $\\pi N_d/(F\\mu_0)$ where:\n",
    "       - $N_d$ - downward exiting radiance at 180 degrees (requested only when SZA=60)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher order moments are calculated as \n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\\bar{x})^k, \\quad k=2,6 \\quad  N=32$$\n",
