Intercomparison of 3D Radiation Codes (I3RC): https://i3rc.gsfc.nasa.gov/
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
I3RC is an ongoing project initiated in the late 1990s. Its goals include: 
- Comparing methods available for 3D atmospheric radiative transfer calculations.
- Providing benchmark results for testing and debugging 3D radiative transfer codes.
- Publishing an open source toolkit (community 3D Monte Carlo code).
- Helping atmospheric science education by creating an archive of illustrative images and other resources on 3D radiative transfer.
